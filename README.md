The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. In most variants, proper nouns,
such as names, places, and brands, are not allowed. Slang words, sometimes referred to as informal or shortened words,
are also not allowed. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, it will be written in all 
its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, one element of a hanged man stick figure will be 
drawn.
This edition is limited to 11 wrong characters.
You can start the game by a Windows command line or Linux terminal: "java -jar hangman_en.jar"
Credits go to Stefan Gerecke who did most of the work creating the gallows.
